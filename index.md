Welcome to the home page of *CepGen*, a generic central exclusive processes events generator released under the {{ site.github.license.name }}.

In a short future, you will find here a summary of all processes and configuration parameters to use with this piece of software.
In the meantime, for a guide on the installation of this library on a fresh system, please [follow this link](install).

This page is currently under heavy construction, but do not hesitate to contact us through the project's [issues page]({{ site.github.issues_url }}) for more information.
