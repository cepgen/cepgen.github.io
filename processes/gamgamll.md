# $$pp \rightarrow p^{(\ast)}(\gamma\gamma \rightarrow \ell^+\ell^-)p^{(\ast)}$$

The two-photon production of lepton pairs is defined with two different approaches in `CepGen`:

- a full matrix elements formalism, aka the `LPAIR` implementation,
- the $$k_{\mathrm{T}}$$-factorised implementation, as introduced in `PPTOLL`.
