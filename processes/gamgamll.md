# Two-photon production of lepton pairs

The $pp \rightarrow p^{(\ast)}(\gamma\gamma \rightarrow \ell^+\ell^-)p^{(\ast)}$ process is defined with two different approaches in CepGen:

- a full matrix elements formalism, aka the `LPAIR` implementation,
- the $k _ {\mathrm T}$-factorised implementation, as introduced in `PPTOLL`.

## Full matrix element
The full description of this two-photon process as previously implemented in `LPAIR` can be reached through the `lpair` process in CepGen.

## $k _ {\mathrm T}$-factorisation

The photon transverse momentum-dependant description of this process as previously developed in [PPtoLL](../bibliography#textbfk-_-mathrmtextbft-factorisation), is provided through the `pptoll` process in CepGen.
You may find a full description of this approach in [this page](../kt-factor)
